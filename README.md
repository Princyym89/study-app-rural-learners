# 🌍 Study App for Rural Learners

A simple and user-friendly web application designed to support learners in **rural areas** by providing **accessible study materials, quizzes, and notes**, even with **limited internet connectivity**.  

This project was built as part of my **ALX Front-End Web Development Capstone Project**, with the goal of empowering students through technology and improving access to education.

## 💡 Inspiration

Growing up and observing challenges in rural education, I noticed how many learners struggle to access reliable learning resources due to **poor internet connectivity** and **limited digital infrastructure**.  

This app aims to **bridge that gap** by offering an easy-to-use platform that works smoothly and can function **even when offline**.  

It’s inspired by my vision to make **digital learning inclusive**, so that every learner — no matter where they are — can study, revise, and grow confidently.
