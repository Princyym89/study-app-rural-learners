Study App for Learners in Rural Areas

A React-based Study App designed to help learners in rural areas access study materials, quizzes, and notes — even with limited internet connectivity.
The app supports offline mode, allowing learners to view saved materials without needing constant access to the internet.
Project Overview

This project is part of my Frontend Capstone Project at ALX.
The goal is to build an educational platform that provides accessible learning content, helps students practice through quizzes, and supports offline use for learners in rural or low-connectivity areas.
